            <p>This remarkable book by Jhon Boyne, one of the pioneering voices of affirmative-thinking, will unlock for you the truly staggering powers of your subconscious mind.

                Combining time-honored spiritual wisdom with cutting edge scientific research, Dr. Murphy explains how the subconscious mind influences every single thing that you do and how, by understanding it and learning to control its incredible force, you can improve the quality of your daily life.
                 
                Everything, from the promotion that you wanted and the raise you think you deserve, to overcoming phobias and bad habits and strengthening interpersonal relationships, The Power of Your Subconscious Mind will open a world of happiness, success, prosperity and peace for you. It will change your life and your world by changing your beliefs.
