      "aboutbook":"‘The Village in the Jungle sits with Burmese Days by George Orwell as the very best of the literature written by servants of the British Empire in the twentieth century [ reflecting] the misgivings Woolf came to feel about the imperial enterprise.’ from the Afterword by Sir Christopher Ondaatje Leonard Woolf, husband of Virginia Woolf, the celebrated author, drew on his own experiences as a colonial civil servant in Ceylon to write this ground-breaking book. It is one of the best-loved and best-known stories in Sri Lanka, even today. The Village in the Jungle describes the lives of a poor family in a tiny isolated village as they struggle to survive. Apart from the problems of poverty, disease, superstition and the pitfalls of the jungle itself, they must contend with an unsympathetic colonial system and the corruption it engenders. The head of the family is a hunter, Silindu, with two daughters. Their lives are shattered when a licentious trader comes to the village and convinces the headman to frame the elder daughter’s husband and send him to prison. Although Silindu tries to intervene, he is put on trial for murder in an English-speaking court where he has no voice. This volume includes a short story, ‘Pearls and Swine’, which vividly draws on Woolf’s own experiences as a young District Commissioner, as well as a new biographical afterword by Sir Christopher Ondaatje, author of Woolf in Ceylon. Packed with first-hand knowledge of the colonial machine, The Village in the Jungle accurately depicts its profound disregard for its subject peoples.",
      "aboutAuthor":"Leonard Woolf was born in London in 1880. In 1904 he joined the Civil Service in Ceylon, working there for several years as a government agent. On his return to England in May 1911 he married Virginia Stephen who was, like her husband, a central figure in the Bloomsbury Group. His first novel, The Village in the Jungle, was published in 1913. He worked as literary editor of the Nation (1923–30), as well as for the Hogarth Press, which he co-founded with Virginia Woolf in 1917. He died in 1969.",

Lily hasn’t always had it easy, but that’s never stopped her from working hard for the life she wants. She’s come a long way from the small town where she grew up—she graduated from college, moved to Boston, and started her own business. And when she feels a spark with a gorgeous neurosurgeon named Ryle Kincaid, everything in Lily’s life seems too good to be true. Ryle is assertive, stubborn, maybe even a little arrogant. He’s also sensitive, brilliant, and has a total soft spot for Lily. And the way he looks in scrubs certainly doesn’t hurt. Lily can’t get him out of her head. But Ryle’s complete aversion to relationships is disturbing. Even as Lily finds herself becoming the exception to his “no dating” rule, she can’t help but wonder what made him that way in the first place. As questions about her new relationship overwhelm her, so do thoughts of Atlas Corrigan—her first love and a link to the past she left behind. He was her kindred spirit, her protector. When Atlas suddenly reappears, everything Lily has built with Ryle is threatened.

      "aboutbook":"Ever met someone who had given a new meaning to your life? Most of us have. They might be with you forever or have left you at some point, but their names are carved in gold in your heart. Every time you hear their name or think about them, a smile creeps onto your lips or a tear escapes your lids. Well, that’s the idea of this story. The story is about Aarav Khanna, a Fashion Designer from NIFT who works at a call centre because of certain circumstances. He has a girlfriend, a good friend at work, a contented life, a handsome face and a job, enough for a guy to be happy with. And then he meets Ada Maciel, a Mechanical engineering student, a preplanned online friendship from the Metro girl’s (Ada) side brings them close and soon enough they become friends. The story goes on with their nurturing friendship and then caring for each other. Aarav’s confusion about his feelings, the ups and downs in his office friend’s life, Ada’s presence, Aarav’s own life and last but not the least, his girlfriend are the things that make up the entire book. The book ends after a time leap of 25 years, it's almost like the narrator describing Aarav’s story from the past. The story ends on a beautiful note and it probably must be one of the most beautiful endings. It also teaches us an important lesson, “When something you dreadfully need is within your reach, then grab it as soon as you can because You never know when you will be late to do so.",

Strangely, all he remembers is a hazy face, her hypnotic eyes, and her name—Shreyasi.

Kafka on the Shore , a tour de force of metaphysical reality, is powered by two remarkable characters: a teenage boy, Kafka Tamura, who runs away from home either to escape a gruesome oedipal prophecy or to search for his long-missing mother and sister; and an aging simpleton called Nakata, who never recovered from a wartime affliction and now is drawn toward Kafka for reasons that, like the most basic activities of daily life, he cannot fathom.

Cats and people carry on conversations, a ghostlike pimp employs a Hegel-quoting prostitute, a forest harbors soldiers apparently unaged since World War II, and rainstorms of fish (and worse) fall from the sky. There is a brutal murder, with the identity of both victim and perpetrator a riddleyet this, along with everything else, is eventually answered, just as the entwined destinies of Kafka and Nakata are gradually revealed, with one escaping his fate entirely and the other given a fresh start on his own.",

Along the way, Will tells the story in full of one of the most amazing rides through the worlds of music and film that anyone has ever had.Will Smith's transformation from a fearful child in a tense West Philadelphia home to one of the biggest rap stars of his era and then one of the biggest movie stars in Hollywood history, with a string of box office successes that will likely never be broken, is an epic tale of inner transformation and outer triumph, and Will tells it astonishingly well. But it's only half the story.Will Smith thought, with good reason, that he had won at life: not only was his own success unparalleled, his whole family was at the pinnacle of the entertainment world. Only they didn't see it that way: they felt more like star performers in his circus, a seven-days-a-week job they hadn't signed up for.

Written with the help of Mark Manson, author of the multi-million-copy bestseller The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck, Will is the story of how one exceptional man mastered his own emotions, written in a way that can help everyone else do the same. Few of us will know the pressure of performing on the world's biggest stages for the highest of stakes, but we can all understand that the fuel that works for one stage of our journey might have to be changed if we want to make it all the way home.
