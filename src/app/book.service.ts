      "aboutbook": "Public understanding of, and outcry over, the dire state of the climate and environment is greater than ever before. Parties across the political spectrum claim to be climate leaders, and overt denial is on the way out. Yet when it comes to slowing the course of the climate and nature crises, despite a growing number of pledges, policies and summits, little ever seems to change. Nature is being destroyed at an unprecedented rate. We remain on course for a catastrophic 3°C of warming. What's holding us back?In this searing and insightful critique, Adrienne Buller examines the fatal biases that have shaped the response of our governing institutions to climate and environmental breakdown, and asks: are the ‘solutions’ being proposed really solutions? Tracing the intricate connections between financial power, economic injustice and ecological crisis, she exposes the myopic economism and market-centric thinking presently undermining a future where all life can flourish. The book examines what is wrong with mainstream climate and environmental governance, from carbon pricing and offset markets to 'green growth', the commodification of nature and the growing influence of the finance industry on environmental policy. In doing so, it exposes the self-defeating logic of a response to these challenges based on creating new opportunities for profit, and a refusal to grapple with the inequalities and injustices that have created them. Both honest and optimistic, The Value of a Whale asks us ― in the face of crisis ― what we really value.",

      "aboutbook": "Paths of Fear is a unique anthology which explores that universal and misunderstood experience we call fear. This enjoyable read is part psychological, part informational, and all inspirational. It is largely personal narrative with a sprinkling of poetry and all entertainment. Paths of Fear explores a broad range of fears from that which manifests in screams of sheer terror, to that immobilizing, fear-ridden freeze we all understand. This survey sheds light on that deep, dark discouragement that reminds us of how we might fall short or fail. It exposes furtive beliefs sometimes rooted in us that we, aren't enough; a destructive idea cultivated in toxic environments which erode us from the inside out. Thought-provoking narratives highlight the many faces of fear with the sensitivity and insight of real experience. A wide variety of real-life examples are offered up on how others have dealt with fearful things and fearful places in life. Some of these circumstances have called for a long endurance, with dignity and grace; others required a special kind of strength and defiance. All are examples of facing fear, on one's own terms, inspiring in their own right. This part psychological survey, part self-help, and part spiritual essay spotlights the true antidote to fear - love, of one kind or another. Secularly accessible, but decidedly faith-based, Paths of Fear de-masks the monsters of circumstance and sheds light on some of the darker recesses of life experience. It is a pleasing, poignant reveal of courage, faith, and modern knowledge balanced with age-old wisdom. Paths of Fear encourages us to rely on our best, healthy sense of true self, and a heartfelt love for others. It's a collection to inspire readers down paths of faith and hope and to encourage anyone through trials of fear they must overcome.",
      "aboutAuthor": "About the Author: Indeed... On being blessed with early spiritual experiences: these would be as a conduit between myself and a renewable fountain of faith which has utterly saved me time and again. Indeed, this source of amazing grace ever rescues, revives, and rejuvenates still my soul. On having a grandmother whose upstairs library I perused: it was here I met first the Caldecott and Newbery classics, enduring poets, composers, story-telling icons and literary giants. Indeed, I was irrevocably impressed. On having an antique, script, manual type-writer tossed my way: it defined my tender years. Indeed, it nurtured my budding muse. On being married to my childhood sweetheart for 30(plus) years: I am in awe of our incredible journey together. We have been honed and humbled even as we've been bathed in bliss. I am grateful he has been my faithful, capable - and especially good-humored companion all this time. My admiration and love for him are indescribable. Indeed, words fail to convey such a divine devotion. On being adoptive-foster parents for nearly a quarter of a century: this means bevies of babies and bus-loads of youth of all ages and stages have graced our home, profoundly altering us. With 13 adopted, and three procured the old-fashioned way, indeed, I love and appreciate beyond expression, being honed and owned all this time by these precious people. On all the above and more, my family, dear friends, Walk of Faith, and my writing journey: these have indeed, all made for the savoriest of lives and the ultimate, beautiful mess. It is to my great delight that such a crazy-wonderful menagerie has somehow chosen me! On writing: Indeed, is there anything better than ever growing, changing, and becoming? Is there anything better than that release of tremors that have rumbled inside for eons, as they built up a force to be reckoned with? When they finally find their focus to surge into a tsunami of positive energy that ripples out into the world - to leave its mark. To leave it just a little better place than they might have found it? Indeed. It is not that I found writing. For some-how, some-why, it found and claimed me. It's not even that I am a writer, per say. I am just a vessel in which a small but powerful portion of that endless stream, that fountain of renewable vigor - pours a bit of itself in me for a time.

Kafka on the Shore , a tour de force of metaphysical reality, is powered by two remarkable characters: a teenage boy, Kafka Tamura, who runs away from home either to escape a gruesome oedipal prophecy or to search for his long-missing mother and sister; and an aging simpleton called Nakata, who never recovered from a wartime affliction and now is drawn toward Kafka for reasons that, like the most basic activities of daily life, he cannot fathom. Their odyssey, as mysterious to them as it is to us, is enriched throughout by vivid accomplices and mesmerizing events. Cats and people carry on conversations, a ghostlike pimp employs a Hegel-quoting prostitute, a forest harbors soldiers apparently unaged since World War II, and rainstorms of fish (and worse) fall from the sky. There is a brutal murder, with the identity of both victim and perpetrator a riddleyet this, along with everything else, is eventually answered, just as the entwined destinies of Kafka and Nakata are gradually revealed, with one escaping his fate entirely and the other given a fresh start on his own.",

He studied to be an engineer and began work as a draftsman. However, his first novel, Poor Folk (1846), was so well received that he abandoned engineering for writing. In 1849, Dostoevsky was arrested for being a part of a revolutionary group that owned an illegal printing press. He was sentenced to be executed, but the sentence was changed at the last minute, and he was sent to a prison camp in Siberia instead. By the time he was released in 1854, he had become a devout believer in both Christianity and Russia - although not in its ruler, the Czar. "

It starts with developing the right mental attitude—the conviction that you have what it takes. This faith in yourself will enable you to program your subconscious mind to convert your dreams and hopes into achievements. God has given you talents. By developing and using them, you stimulate your conscious mind, which is the motor that energizes the subconscious mind—the engine that will do the work. Within these pages, you will read how poets, artists, inventors, and entrepreneurs implemented their dreams and ideas to become rewarding and profitable accomplishments, and how you can apply the same techniques to enrich your life.

      "aboutAuthor":"Murphy was born in Ireland, the son of a private boy's school headmaster and raised a Roman Catholic. He studied for the priesthood and joined the Jesuits. In his twenties, an experience with healing prayer led him to leave the Jesuits and move to the United States, where he became a pharmacist in New York (having a degree in chemistry by that time). Here he attended the Church of the Healing Christ (part of the Church of Divine Science), where Emmet Fox had become minister in 1931. ",

Such conversations start a process of healing, alleviation of guilt, or simply bring joy to the heart and confirmation that there is life after death.",

      "aboutbook": " 'You Are The Best Wife: A True Love Story’ is a story about how people find true love and comfort in dissimilarities; about how two people with absolutely different ideologies meet and fall in love. The story revolves around Bhavna and Ajay. Bhavna loves living life for others while Ajay loves living for himself; Bhavna is more spontaneous, never planning the next move and living life with the flow. On the other hand, living life without planning a single move is almost blasphemous to Ajay. Yet, they fall in love; they get married and love changes both of them for good. However, destiny had some other plans for this couple in love; and, midway through their happiness, Bhavna had to resign from life. But does this halt mean the end of love? Written in frank and clear words with generous dosage of humour, 'You Are the Best Wife’ is hailed as a true love story amidst all adversities. It is an inspiring and bittersweet tale of a youth that metamorphoses into a whole new being after being touched by love. ",

Kya Clark is barefoot and wild; unfit for polite society. So in late 1969, when the popular Chase Andrews is found dead, locals immediately suspect her.But Kya is not what they say. A born naturalist with just one day of school, she takes life's lessons from the land, learning the real ways of the world from the dishonest signals of fireflies. But while she has the skills to live in solitude forever, the time comes when she yearns to be touched and loved. Drawn to two young men from town, who are each intrigued by her wild beauty, Kya opens herself to a new and startling world—until the unthinkable happens.In Where the Crawdads Sing, Owens juxtaposes an exquisite ode to the natural world against a profound coming of age story and haunting mystery. Thought-provoking, wise, and deeply moving, Owens’s debut novel reminds us that we are forever shaped by the child within us, while also subject to the beautiful and violent secrets that nature keeps.The story asks how isolation influences the behavior of a young woman, who like all of us, has the genetic propensity to belong to a group.

      "aboutbook":"High above the sky stands Swarga, paradise, abode of the gods. Still above is Vaikuntha, heaven, abode of God. The doorkeepers of Vaikuntha are the twins, Jaya and Vijaya, both whose names mean ‘victory’. One keeps you in Swarga; the other raises you into Vaikuntha. In Vaikuntha there is bliss forever, in Swarga there is pleasure for only as long as you deserve. What is the difference between Jaya and Vijaya? Solve this puzzle and you will solve the mystery of the Mahabharata. In this enthralling retelling of India’s greatest epic, the Mahabharata, originally known as Jaya, Devdutt Pattanaik seamlessly weaves into a single narrative plots from the Sanskrit classic as well as its many folk and regional variants, including the Pandavani of Chattisgarh, Gondhal of Maharashtra, Terukkuttu of Tamil Nadu, and Yakshagana of Karnataka.Richly illustrated with over 250 line drawings by the author, the 108 chapters abound with little-known details such as the names of the hundred Kauravas, the worship of Draupadi as a goddess in Tamil Nadu, the stories of Astika, Madhavi, Jaimini, Aravan and Barbareek, the Mahabharata version of the Shakuntalam and the Ramayana, and the dating of the war based on astronomical data. With clarity and simplicity, the tales in this elegant volume reveal the eternal relevance of the Mahabharata, the complex and disturbing meditation on the human condition that has shaped Indian thought for over 3000 years.",

Parties across the political spectrum claim to be climate leaders, and overt denial is on the way out. Yet when it comes to slowing the course of the climate and nature crises, despite a growing number of pledges, policies and summits, little ever seems to change. Nature is being destroyed at an unprecedented rate. We remain on course for a catastrophic 3°C of warming. What's holding us back?In this searing and insightful critique, Adrienne Buller examines the fatal biases that have shaped the response of our governing institutions to climate and environmental breakdown, and asks: are the ‘solutions’ being proposed really solutions? Tracing the intricate connections between financial power, economic injustice and ecological crisis, she exposes the myopic economism and market-centric thinking presently undermining a future where all life can flourish. The book examines what is wrong with mainstream climate and environmental governance, from carbon pricing and offset markets to 'green growth', the commodification of nature and the growing influence of the finance industry on environmental policy. In doing so, it exposes the self-defeating logic of a response to these challenges based on creating new opportunities for profit, and a refusal to grapple with the inequalities and injustices that have created them. Both honest and optimistic, The Value of a Whale asks us ― in the face of crisis ― what we really value.",

      "aboutbook":"NATIONAL BESTSELLER - Rizzoli & Isles are back! From New York Times bestselling author Tess Gerritsen, this 'shocking and fast-paced' (Karin Slaughter) thriller has Jane and Maura investigating a brutal murder with dire implications, and this time, with Jane's intrepid mother, Angela, looking into a mystery of her own.Boston homicide detective Jane Rizzoli and medical examiner Maura Isles are newly plagued by what seems like a completely senseless murder. Sofia Suarez, a widow and nurse who was universally liked by her neighbors, lies bludgeoned to death in her own home. But anything can happen behind closed doors, and Sofia seemed to have plenty of secrets in her last days, making covert phone calls to traceless burner phones. When Jane finally makes a connection between Sofia and the victim of a hit-and-run from months earlier, the case only grows more blurry. What exactly was Sofia involved in? One thing is clear: The killer will do anything it takes to keep their secret safe.Meanwhile, Angela Rizzoli hasn't had a decent night's sleep in all the years since her daughter became a homicide detective. Maybe the apple didn't fall too far from the tree: Nothing in Angela's neighborhood gets by her--not the gossip about a runaway teenager down the block and definitely not the strange neighbors who have just moved in across the street. Angela's sure there's no such thing as coincidence in her sleepy suburb. If only Jane would listen--instead she writes off Angela's concerns as the result of an overactive imagination. But Angela's convinced there's a real wolf in her vicinity, and her cries might now fall on deaf ears.With so much happening on the Sofia case, Jane and Maura already struggle to see the forest for the trees, but will they lose sight of something sinister happening much closer to home?",
      "aboutAuthor":"Bestselling author Tess Gerritsen is also a physician, and she brings to her novels her first-hand knowledge of emergency and autopsy rooms. Her thrillers featuring homicide detective Jane Rizzoli and medical examiner Maura Isles inspired the hit TV series Rizzoli & Isles. But Gerritsen's interests span far more than medicine and crime. As an anthropology student at Stanford University, she catalogued centuries-old human remains, and she continues to travel the world, driven by her fascination with ancient cultures and bizarre natural phenomena.",

      "aboutbook":"Paths of Fear is a unique anthology which explores that universal and misunderstood experience we call fear. This enjoyable read is part psychological, part informational, and all inspirational. It is largely personal narrative with a sprinkling of poetry and all entertainment. Paths of Fear explores a broad range of fears from that which manifests in screams of sheer terror, to that immobilizing, fear-ridden freeze we all understand. This survey sheds light on that deep, dark discouragement that reminds us of how we might fall short or fail. It exposes furtive beliefs sometimes rooted in us that we, aren't enough; a destructive idea cultivated in toxic environments which erode us from the inside out. Thought-provoking narratives highlight the many faces of fear with the sensitivity and insight of real experience. A wide variety of real-life examples are offered up on how others have dealt with fearful things and fearful places in life. Some of these circumstances have called for a long endurance, with dignity and grace; others required a special kind of strength and defiance. All are examples of facing fear, on one's own terms, inspiring in their own right. This part psychological survey, part self-help, and part spiritual essay spotlights the true antidote to fear - love, of one kind or another. Secularly accessible, but decidedly faith-based, Paths of Fear de-masks the monsters of circumstance and sheds light on some of the darker recesses of life experience. It is a pleasing, poignant reveal of courage, faith, and modern knowledge balanced with age-old wisdom. Paths of Fear encourages us to rely on our best, healthy sense of true self, and a heartfelt love for others. It's a collection to inspire readers down paths of faith and hope and to encourage anyone through trials of fear they must overcome.",
      "aboutAuthor":"About the Author: Indeed... On being blessed with early spiritual experiences: these would be as a conduit between myself and a renewable fountain of faith which has utterly saved me time and again. Indeed, this source of amazing grace ever rescues, revives, and rejuvenates still my soul. On having a grandmother whose upstairs library I perused: it was here I met first the Caldecott and Newbery classics, enduring poets, composers, story-telling icons and literary giants. Indeed, I was irrevocably impressed. On having an antique, script, manual type-writer tossed my way: it defined my tender years. Indeed, it nurtured my budding muse. On being married to my childhood sweetheart for 30(plus) years: I am in awe of our incredible journey together. We have been honed and humbled even as we've been bathed in bliss. I am grateful he has been my faithful, capable - and especially good-humored companion all this time. My admiration and love for him are indescribable. Indeed, words fail to convey such a divine devotion. On being adoptive-foster parents for nearly a quarter of a century: this means bevies of babies and bus-loads of youth of all ages and stages have graced our home, profoundly altering us. With 13 adopted, and three procured the old-fashioned way, indeed, I love and appreciate beyond expression, being honed and owned all this time by these precious people. On all the above and more, my family, dear friends, Walk of Faith, and my writing journey: these have indeed, all made for the savoriest of lives and the ultimate, beautiful mess. It is to my great delight that such a crazy-wonderful menagerie has somehow chosen me! On writing: Indeed, is there anything better than ever growing, changing, and becoming? Is there anything better than that release of tremors that have rumbled inside for eons, as they built up a force to be reckoned with? When they finally find their focus to surge into a tsunami of positive energy that ripples out into the world - to leave its mark. To leave it just a little better place than they might have found it? Indeed. It is not that I found writing. For some-how, some-why, it found and claimed me. It's not even that I am a writer, per say. I am just a vessel in which a small but powerful portion of that endless stream, that fountain of renewable vigor - pours a bit of itself in me for a time.

Kafka on the Shore , a tour de force of metaphysical reality, is powered by two remarkable characters: a teenage boy, Kafka Tamura, who runs away from home either to escape a gruesome oedipal prophecy or to search for his long-missing mother and sister; and an aging simpleton called Nakata, who never recovered from a wartime affliction and now is drawn toward Kafka for reasons that, like the most basic activities of daily life, he cannot fathom. Their odyssey, as mysterious to them as it is to us, is enriched throughout by vivid accomplices and mesmerizing events. Cats and people carry on conversations, a ghostlike pimp employs a Hegel-quoting prostitute, a forest harbors soldiers apparently unaged since World War II, and rainstorms of fish (and worse) fall from the sky. There is a brutal murder, with the identity of both victim and perpetrator a riddleyet this, along with everything else, is eventually answered, just as the entwined destinies of Kafka and Nakata are gradually revealed, with one escaping his fate entirely and the other given a fresh start on his own.",

Bix is 40, with four kids, restless, desperate for a new idea, when he stumbles into a conversation group, mostly Columbia professors, one of whom is experimenting with downloading or externalizing memory. It's 2010. Within a decade, Bix's new technology, Own Your Unconscious--that allows you access to every memory you've ever had, and to share every memory in exchange for access to the memories of others--has seduced multitudes. But not everyone.In spellbinding interlocking narratives, Egan spins out the consequences of Own Your Unconscious through the lives of multiple characters whose paths intersect over several decades. Intellectually dazzling, The Candy House is also extraordinarily moving, a testament to the tenacity and transcendence of human longing for real connection, love, family, privacy and redemption. In the world of Egan's spectacular imagination, there are counters who track and exploit desires and there are eluders, those who understand the price of taking a bite of the Candy House. Egan introduces these characters in an astonishing array of narrative styles--from omniscient to first person plural to a duet of voices, an epistolary chapter and a chapter of tweets.If Goon Squad was organized like a concept album, The Candy House incorporates Electronic Dance Music's more disjunctive approach. The parts are titled: Build, Break, Drop. With an emphasis on gaming, portals, and alternate worlds, its structure also suggests the experience of moving among dimensions in a role-playing game. ",
      "aboutAuthor":" Jennifer Egan is the author of six previous books of fiction: Manhattan Beach, winner of the Andrew Carnegie Medal for Excellence in Fiction; A Visit from the Goon Squad, which won the Pulitzer Prize and the National Book Critics Circle Award; The Keep; the story collection Emerald City; Look at Me, a National Book Award Finalist; and The Invisible Circus. Her work has appeared in The New Yorker, Harper's Magazine, Granta, McSweeney's, and The New York Times Magazine. The Candy House is a bold, brilliant imagining of a world that is moments away. Egan takes to stunning new heights her deeply intuitive forays into the darker aspects of our technology-driven, image-saturated culture (Vogue). The Candy House delivers an absolutely extraordinary combination of fierce, exhilarating intelligence and heart.Her website is JenniferEgan.com.",

      "aboutbook":"#1 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER • Over two million copies sold! Packed with incredible insight about what it means to be a woman today.”—Reese Witherspoon (Reese’s Book Club Pick)In her most revealing and powerful memoir yet, the activist, speaker, bestselling author, and “patron saint of female empowerment” (People) explores the joy and peace we discover when we stop striving to meet others’ expectations and start trusting the voice deep within us.NAMED ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS OF THE YEAR BY O: The Oprah Magazine • The Washington Post • Cosmopolitan • Marie Claire • Bloomberg • Parade • “Untamed will liberate women—emotionally, spiritually, and physically. It is phenomenal.”—Elizabeth Gilbert, author of City of Girls and Eat Pray LoveThis is how you find yourself.There is a voice of longing inside each woman. We strive so mightily to be good: good partners, daughters, mothers, employees, and friends. We hope all this striving will make us feel alive. Instead, it leaves us feeling weary, stuck, overwhelmed, and underwhelmed. We look at our lives and wonder: Wasn’t it all supposed to be more beautiful than this? We quickly silence that question, telling ourselves to be grateful, hiding our discontent—even from ourselves. For many years, Glennon Doyle denied her own discontent. Then, while speaking at a conference, she looked at a woman across the room and fell instantly in love. Three words flooded her mind: There She Is. At first, Glennon assumed these words came to her from on high. But she soon realized they had come to her from within. This was her own voice—the one she had buried beneath decades of numbing addictions, cultural conditioning, and institutional allegiances. This was the voice of the girl she had been before the world told her who to be. Glennon decided to quit abandoning herself and to instead abandon the world’s expectations of her. She quit being good so she could be free. She quit pleasing and started living. Soulful and uproarious, forceful and tender, Untamed is both an intimate memoir and a galvanizing wake-up call. It is the story of how one woman learned that a responsible mother is not one who slowly dies for her children, but one who shows them how to fully live. It is the story of navigating divorce, forming a new blended family, and discovering that the brokenness or wholeness of a family depends not on its structure but on each member’s ability to bring her full self to the table. And it is the story of how each of us can begin to trust ourselves enough to set boundaries, make peace with our bodies, honor our anger and heartbreak, and unleash our truest, wildest instincts so that we become women who can finally look at ourselves and say: There She Is. Untamed shows us how to be brave. As Glennon insists: The braver we are, the luckier we get.",
      "aboutAuthor":"Author, activist, founder of Together Rising, and host of the We Can Do Hard Things podcast Glennon Doyle is the author of the #1 New York Times bestseller Untamed, a Reese’s Book Club selection, which has sold over two million copies. She is also the author of the #1 New York Times bestseller Love Warrior, an Oprah’s Book Club selection, and Carry On, Warrior. An activist and “patron saint of female empowerment” (People), Glennon hosts the We Can Do Hard Things podcast. She is the founder and president of Together Rising, an all-women-led nonprofit organization that has revolutionized grassroots philanthropy—raising over $30 million for women, families, and children in crisis. Glennon lives in Florida with her wife and three children.“She is a terrific storyteller. . . . Whether discussing her children or the world outside, challenging conformity, confronting misogyny, or standing up to religious bigotry, her goal as a memoirist (and as a person) is to defy expectations and to help others break out of their cultural cages so that everyone can find their own version of humanity. A bracing jolt of honesty from someone who knows what she wants to say and isn’t afraid to say it.”—Booklist (starred review)",

Martha Jackson is at the centre of post World War 2's New York art scene, and the social and sexual turbulence of the 1950s.

    "aboutbook":"From a critically acclaimed New York Times bestselling author and poet comes “a delightfully hybrid book: part anthology, part critical study, part autobiography” (Chicago Tribune) that is organized around fifty-one remarkable poems by poets such as Robert Frost, Emily Dickinson, Wallace Stevens, and Sylvia Plath.For Jill Bialosky, certain poems stand out like signposts at pivotal moments in a life: the death of a father, adolescence, first love, leaving home, the suicide of a sister, marriage, the birth of a child, the day in New York City the Twin Towers fell. As Bialosky narrates these moments, she illuminates the ways in which particular poems offered insight, compassion, and connection, and shows how poetry can be a blueprint for living. In Poetry Will Save Your Life, Bialosky recalls when she encountered each formative poem, and how its importance and meaning evolved over time, allowing new insights and perceptions to emerge.While Bialosky’s personal stories animate each poem, they touch on many universal experiences, from the awkwardness of girlhood, to crises of faith and identity, from braving a new life in a foreign city to enduring the loss of a loved one, from becoming a parent to growing creatively as a poet and artist. Each moment and poem illustrate “not only how to read poetry, but also how to love poetry” (Christian Science Monitor). ",
    "aboutAuthor":"Jill Bialosky is the author of four acclaimed collections of poetry. Her poems have appeared in The New Yorker, The New York Times, and The Atlantic, among others. She is the author of several books, including History of a Suicide, Asylum, and Poetry Will Save Your Life. In 2015, Jill was honored by the Poetry Society of America for her distinguished contribution to the field of poetry. She lives in New York City. Find out more at JillBialosky.com. “Poetry Will Save Your Life is one of the most moving memoirs I’ve ever read, but it’s so much more. Bialosky does something miraculous: as she shares stories from her life, she shows how specific poems can help all of us make sense of our own lives and the world.

    "aboutAuthor":"Healing comes in waves is a amazing book by author Twinkle patel . The storyline is amazing and the characters are well developed. Healing Comes In Waves will heal our heart and mind from various things and also it gives some hope to move on. The quotes in the beginning of every chapter related to each topic and a brief introduction that took place before entering into the chapters of poems are all will give an idea before jumping into the emotional pool filled with words of poems. But I am not sure how these topics are interrelated and what basis the author has selected the headers to give a complete feel of book. It doesn't look like a story related to each other instead it resembles like random pick and common things are discussed to get healed. Anyways with an easy language and precise manner, the author has crafted all the emotions nicely to heal the mind and it shows a ray of hope to nurture us. i recommend this book.",

It Carries The Urdu Text With Parallel Roman Script, A New Introduction, Several New Poems -- And Substantive Revisions, Wherever Necessary.Faiz Ahmed Faiz is the most famous contemporary Urdu poet of the twentieth century who appeals both to the common man as well as the elite connoisseurs of poetry. Faiz's ghazals reflect a strong influence of the Persian style and diction, because of which he is often considered the inheritor of the tradition of Ghalib; and at the same time several of them are written in a simple conversational style dealing with the problems of the common man. Faiz was a committed poet who regarded poetry as a vehicle of serious thought rather than just a pleasurable pastime and often used it to champion the cause of socialistic humanism. Born in Sialkot in 1911, Faiz began his career as a lecturer in English but soon turned to journalism where he excelled, rising to the post of editor of The Pakistan Times. In 1951 the Pakistan government sentenced him to four years imprisonment on the charges of complicity in a failed coup attempt known as the Rawalpindi Conspiracy case. While in jail he wrote two of his greatest works, Dasta-e-Saba and Zindan-Nama. During the regime of Zia-ul-Haq he was forced into exile to Beirut. He returned to Pakistan in 1982 and two years later he passed away. This book offers a selection of the best of Faiz's ghazals and nazms along with their English translations as well as transliterations so you can enjoy the beauty and richness of Urdu language as you read the English transliteration while the translation helps you understand the meaning with all its subtle nuances.

I’d never had a crush on anyone. No boys, no girls, not a single person I had ever met. What did that mean?

As she starts university with her best friends, Pip and Jason, in a whole new town far from home, Georgia’s ready to find romance, and with her outgoing roommate on her side and a place in the Shakespeare Society, her ‘teenage dream’ is in sight. But when her romance plan wreaks havoc amongst her friends, Georgia ends up in her own comedy of errors, and she starts to question why love seems so easy for other people but not for her.

The only hurdle in its path is Guru Dronacharya’s son, the mighty but accursed warrior ashwatthama, who lost all his powers following Lord Krishna curse, and who unwittingly finds himself drawn into the quest of the lost bow of Lord rama—the Kodandera as ghosts of the distant past return to haunt him, and the line between friends and enemies blurs, ashwatthama must fight his inner demons to emerge victorious. He undertakes a perilous journey—across the vast plains of the Ganges, to the snow-capped peaks of the himavant—where the price of failure is a fate worse than death, and death is a privilege not granted to ashwatthama.

                    "aboutAuthor":"Charles John Huffam Dickens ( 7 February 1812 – 9 June 1870) was an English writer and social critic. He created some of the world's best-known fictional characters and is regarded by many as the greatest novelist of the Victorian era. His works enjoyed unprecedented popularity during his lifetime and, by the 20th century, critics and scholars had recognised him as a literary genius. His novels and short stories are widely read today. Dickens's literary success began with the 1836 serial publication of The Pickwick Papers. Within a few years he had become an international literary celebrity, famous for his humour, satire and keen observation of character and society. His novels, most of them published in monthly or weekly instalments, pioneered the serial publication of narrative fiction, which became the dominant Victorian mode for novel publication. However, Oscar Wilde, Henry James and Virginia Woolf complained of a lack of psychological depth, loose writing and a vein of sentimentalism. The term Dickensian is used to describe something that is reminiscent of Dickens and his writings, such as poor social or working conditions, or comically repulsive characters. "

Along the way, Will tells the story in full of one of the most amazing rides through the worlds of music and film that anyone has ever had.Will Smith's transformation from a fearful child in a tense West Philadelphia home to one of the biggest rap stars of his era and then one of the biggest movie stars in Hollywood history, with a string of box office successes that will likely never be broken, is an epic tale of inner transformation and outer triumph, and Will tells it astonishingly well. But it's only half the story.Will Smith thought, with good reason, that he had won at life: not only was his own success unparalleled, his whole family was at the pinnacle of the entertainment world. Only they didn't see it that way: they felt more like star performers in his circus, a seven-days-a-week job they hadn't signed up for.

Written with the help of Mark Manson, author of the multi-million-copy bestseller The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck, Will is the story of how one exceptional man mastered his own emotions, written in a way that can help everyone else do the same. Few of us will know the pressure of performing on the world's biggest stages for the highest of stakes, but we can all understand that the fuel that works for one stage of our journey might have to be changed if we want to make it all the way home.
