      "aboutbook": "Public understanding of, and outcry over, the dire state of the climate and environment is greater than ever before. Parties across the political spectrum claim to be climate leaders, and overt denial is on the way out. Yet when it comes to slowing the course of the climate and nature crises, despite a growing number of pledges, policies and summits, little ever seems to change. Nature is being destroyed at an unprecedented rate. We remain on course for a catastrophic 3°C of warming. What's holding us back?In this searing and insightful critique, Adrienne Buller examines the fatal biases that have shaped the response of our governing institutions to climate and environmental breakdown, and asks: are the ‘solutions’ being proposed really solutions? Tracing the intricate connections between financial power, economic injustice and ecological crisis, she exposes the myopic economism and market-centric thinking presently undermining a future where all life can flourish. The book examines what is wrong with mainstream climate and environmental governance, from carbon pricing and offset markets to 'green growth', the commodification of nature and the growing influence of the finance industry on environmental policy. In doing so, it exposes the self-defeating logic of a response to these challenges based on creating new opportunities for profit, and a refusal to grapple with the inequalities and injustices that have created them. Both honest and optimistic, The Value of a Whale asks us ― in the face of crisis ― what we really value.",

      "aboutbook": "Paths of Fear is a unique anthology which explores that universal and misunderstood experience we call fear. This enjoyable read is part psychological, part informational, and all inspirational. It is largely personal narrative with a sprinkling of poetry and all entertainment. Paths of Fear explores a broad range of fears from that which manifests in screams of sheer terror, to that immobilizing, fear-ridden freeze we all understand. This survey sheds light on that deep, dark discouragement that reminds us of how we might fall short or fail. It exposes furtive beliefs sometimes rooted in us that we, aren't enough; a destructive idea cultivated in toxic environments which erode us from the inside out. Thought-provoking narratives highlight the many faces of fear with the sensitivity and insight of real experience. A wide variety of real-life examples are offered up on how others have dealt with fearful things and fearful places in life. Some of these circumstances have called for a long endurance, with dignity and grace; others required a special kind of strength and defiance. All are examples of facing fear, on one's own terms, inspiring in their own right. This part psychological survey, part self-help, and part spiritual essay spotlights the true antidote to fear - love, of one kind or another. Secularly accessible, but decidedly faith-based, Paths of Fear de-masks the monsters of circumstance and sheds light on some of the darker recesses of life experience. It is a pleasing, poignant reveal of courage, faith, and modern knowledge balanced with age-old wisdom. Paths of Fear encourages us to rely on our best, healthy sense of true self, and a heartfelt love for others. It's a collection to inspire readers down paths of faith and hope and to encourage anyone through trials of fear they must overcome.",
      "aboutAuthor": "About the Author: Indeed... On being blessed with early spiritual experiences: these would be as a conduit between myself and a renewable fountain of faith which has utterly saved me time and again. Indeed, this source of amazing grace ever rescues, revives, and rejuvenates still my soul. On having a grandmother whose upstairs library I perused: it was here I met first the Caldecott and Newbery classics, enduring poets, composers, story-telling icons and literary giants. Indeed, I was irrevocably impressed. On having an antique, script, manual type-writer tossed my way: it defined my tender years. Indeed, it nurtured my budding muse. On being married to my childhood sweetheart for 30(plus) years: I am in awe of our incredible journey together. We have been honed and humbled even as we've been bathed in bliss. I am grateful he has been my faithful, capable - and especially good-humored companion all this time. My admiration and love for him are indescribable. Indeed, words fail to convey such a divine devotion. On being adoptive-foster parents for nearly a quarter of a century: this means bevies of babies and bus-loads of youth of all ages and stages have graced our home, profoundly altering us. With 13 adopted, and three procured the old-fashioned way, indeed, I love and appreciate beyond expression, being honed and owned all this time by these precious people. On all the above and more, my family, dear friends, Walk of Faith, and my writing journey: these have indeed, all made for the savoriest of lives and the ultimate, beautiful mess. It is to my great delight that such a crazy-wonderful menagerie has somehow chosen me! On writing: Indeed, is there anything better than ever growing, changing, and becoming? Is there anything better than that release of tremors that have rumbled inside for eons, as they built up a force to be reckoned with? When they finally find their focus to surge into a tsunami of positive energy that ripples out into the world - to leave its mark. To leave it just a little better place than they might have found it? Indeed. It is not that I found writing. For some-how, some-why, it found and claimed me. It's not even that I am a writer, per say. I am just a vessel in which a small but powerful portion of that endless stream, that fountain of renewable vigor - pours a bit of itself in me for a time.

Kafka on the Shore , a tour de force of metaphysical reality, is powered by two remarkable characters: a teenage boy, Kafka Tamura, who runs away from home either to escape a gruesome oedipal prophecy or to search for his long-missing mother and sister; and an aging simpleton called Nakata, who never recovered from a wartime affliction and now is drawn toward Kafka for reasons that, like the most basic activities of daily life, he cannot fathom. Their odyssey, as mysterious to them as it is to us, is enriched throughout by vivid accomplices and mesmerizing events. Cats and people carry on conversations, a ghostlike pimp employs a Hegel-quoting prostitute, a forest harbors soldiers apparently unaged since World War II, and rainstorms of fish (and worse) fall from the sky. There is a brutal murder, with the identity of both victim and perpetrator a riddleyet this, along with everything else, is eventually answered, just as the entwined destinies of Kafka and Nakata are gradually revealed, with one escaping his fate entirely and the other given a fresh start on his own.",

He went home and began writing that night.His first novel, Hear the Wind Sing, won the Gunzou Literature Prize for budding writers in 1979.

This wildly addictive journey of a reclusive Hollywood starlet and her tumultuous Tinseltown journey comes with unexpected twists and the most satisfying of drama.” —PopSugar In this entrancing novel “that speaks to the Marilyn Monroe and Elizabeth Taylor in us all” (Kirkus Reviews), a legendary film actress reflects on her relentless rise to the top and the risks she took, the loves she lost, and the long-held secrets the public could never imagine.Aging and reclusive Hollywood movie icon Evelyn Hugo is finally ready to tell the truth about her glamorous and scandalous life. But when she chooses unknown magazine reporter Monique Grant for the job, no one is more astounded than Monique herself. Why her? Why now? Monique is not exactly on top of the world. Her husband has left her, and her professional life is going nowhere. Regardless of why Evelyn has selected her to write her biography, Monique is determined to use this opportunity to jumpstart her career.

From making her way to Los Angeles in the 1950s to her decision to leave show business in the ‘80s, and, of course, the seven husbands along the way, Evelyn unspools a tale of ruthless ambition, unexpected friendship, and a great forbidden love.

Kya Clark is barefoot and wild; unfit for polite society. So in late 1969, when the popular Chase Andrews is found dead, locals immediately suspect her.But Kya is not what they say. A born naturalist with just one day of school, she takes life's lessons from the land, learning the real ways of the world from the dishonest signals of fireflies. But while she has the skills to live in solitude forever, the time comes when she yearns to be touched and loved. Drawn to two young men from town, who are each intrigued by her wild beauty, Kya opens herself to a new and startling world—until the unthinkable happens.In Where the Crawdads Sing, Owens juxtaposes an exquisite ode to the natural world against a profound coming of age story and haunting mystery. Thought-provoking, wise, and deeply moving, Owens’s debut novel reminds us that we are forever shaped by the child within us, while also subject to the beautiful and violent secrets that nature keeps.The story asks how isolation influences the behavior of a young woman, who like all of us, has the genetic propensity to belong to a group. The clues to the mystery are brushed into the lush habitat and natural histories of its wild creatures.",

The opportunity to be scouted by dozens of college coaches is a dream come true.Samuel is an amazing athlete, with speed, quick­ness, and an astonishing vertical leap. The rest of his game, though, needs work, and the American coaches are less than impressed.During the tournament, Samuel receives dev­astating news from home: A civil war is raging across South Sudan, and rebel troops have ran­sacked his village. His father is dead, his sister is missing, and his mother and two younger brothers are in a refugee camp.Samuel desperately wants to go home, but it's just not possible. Partly out of sympathy, the coach of North Carolina Central offers him a scholar­ship. Samuel moves to Durham, enrolls in classes, joins the team, and prepares to sit out his freshman season.

From New York Times bestselling author Tess Gerritsen, this 'shocking and fast-paced' (Karin Slaughter) thriller has Jane and Maura investigating a brutal murder with dire implications, and this time, with Jane's intrepid mother, Angela, looking into a mystery of her own.Boston homicide detective Jane Rizzoli and medical examiner Maura Isles are newly plagued by what seems like a completely senseless murder. Sofia Suarez, a widow and nurse who was universally liked by her neighbors, lies bludgeoned to death in her own home. But anything can happen behind closed doors, and Sofia seemed to have plenty of secrets in her last days, making covert phone calls to traceless burner phones. When Jane finally makes a connection between Sofia and the victim of a hit-and-run from months earlier, the case only grows more blurry. What exactly was Sofia involved in? One thing is clear: The killer will do anything it takes to keep their secret safe.Meanwhile, Angela Rizzoli hasn't had a decent night's sleep in all the years since her daughter became a homicide detective. Maybe the apple didn't fall too far from the tree: Nothing in Angela's neighborhood gets by her--not the gossip about a runaway teenager down the block and definitely not the strange neighbors who have just moved in across the street. Angela's sure there's no such thing as coincidence in her sleepy suburb. If only Jane would listen--instead she writes off Angela's concerns as the result of an overactive imagination. But Angela's convinced there's a real wolf in her vicinity, and her cries might now fall on deaf ears.With so much happening on the Sofia case, Jane and Maura already struggle to see the forest for the trees, but will they lose sight of something sinister happening much closer to home?",
      "aboutAuthor": "Bestselling author Tess Gerritsen is also a physician, and she brings to her novels her first-hand knowledge of emergency and autopsy rooms. Her thrillers featuring homicide detective Jane Rizzoli and medical examiner Maura Isles inspired the hit TV series Rizzoli & Isles. But Gerritsen's interests span far more than medicine and crime. As an anthropology student at Stanford University, she catalogued centuries-old human remains, and she continues to travel the world, driven by her fascination with ancient cultures and bizarre natural phenomena.",

Bix is 40, with four kids, restless, desperate for a new idea, when he stumbles into a conversation group, mostly Columbia professors, one of whom is experimenting with downloading or externalizing memory. It's 2010. Within a decade, Bix's new technology, Own Your Unconscious--that allows you access to every memory you've ever had, and to share every memory in exchange for access to the memories of others--has seduced multitudes. But not everyone.In spellbinding interlocking narratives, Egan spins out the consequences of Own Your Unconscious through the lives of multiple characters whose paths intersect over several decades. Intellectually dazzling, The Candy House is also extraordinarily moving, a testament to the tenacity and transcendence of human longing for real connection, love, family, privacy and redemption. In the world of Egan's spectacular imagination, there are counters who track and exploit desires and there are eluders, those who understand the price of taking a bite of the Candy House. Egan introduces these characters in an astonishing array of narrative styles--from omniscient to first person plural to a duet of voices, an epistolary chapter and a chapter of tweets.If Goon Squad was organized like a concept album, The Candy House incorporates Electronic Dance Music's more disjunctive approach. The parts are titled: Build, Break, Drop. With an emphasis on gaming, portals, and alternate worlds, its structure also suggests the experience of moving among dimensions in a role-playing game. ",

Her work has appeared in The New Yorker, Harper's Magazine, Granta, McSweeney's, and The New York Times Magazine. The Candy House is a bold, brilliant imagining of a world that is moments away. Egan takes to stunning new heights her deeply intuitive forays into the darker aspects of our technology-driven, image-saturated culture (Vogue).

      "aboutbook": "#1 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER • Over two million copies sold! Packed with incredible insight about what it means to be a woman today.”—Reese Witherspoon (Reese’s Book Club Pick)In her most revealing and powerful memoir yet, the activist, speaker, bestselling author, and “patron saint of female empowerment” (People) explores the joy and peace we discover when we stop striving to meet others’ expectations and start trusting the voice deep within us.NAMED ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS OF THE YEAR BY O: The Oprah Magazine • The Washington Post • Cosmopolitan • Marie Claire • Bloomberg • Parade • “Untamed will liberate women—emotionally, spiritually, and physically. It is phenomenal.”—Elizabeth Gilbert, author of City of Girls and Eat Pray LoveThis is how you find yourself.There is a voice of longing inside each woman. We strive so mightily to be good: good partners, daughters, mothers, employees, and friends. We hope all this striving will make us feel alive. Instead, it leaves us feeling weary, stuck, overwhelmed, and underwhelmed. We look at our lives and wonder: Wasn’t it all supposed to be more beautiful than this? We quickly silence that question, telling ourselves to be grateful, hiding our discontent—even from ourselves. For many years, Glennon Doyle denied her own discontent. Then, while speaking at a conference, she looked at a woman across the room and fell instantly in love. Three words flooded her mind: There She Is. At first, Glennon assumed these words came to her from on high. But she soon realized they had come to her from within. This was her own voice—the one she had buried beneath decades of numbing addictions, cultural conditioning, and institutional allegiances. This was the voice of the girl she had been before the world told her who to be. Glennon decided to quit abandoning herself and to instead abandon the world’s expectations of her. She quit being good so she could be free. She quit pleasing and started living. Soulful and uproarious, forceful and tender, Untamed is both an intimate memoir and a galvanizing wake-up call. It is the story of how one woman learned that a responsible mother is not one who slowly dies for her children, but one who shows them how to fully live. It is the story of navigating divorce, forming a new blended family, and discovering that the brokenness or wholeness of a family depends not on its structure but on each member’s ability to bring her full self to the table. And it is the story of how each of us can begin to trust ourselves enough to set boundaries, make peace with our bodies, honor our anger and heartbreak, and unleash our truest, wildest instincts so that we become women who can finally look at ourselves and say: There She Is. Untamed shows us how to be brave. As Glennon insists: The braver we are, the luckier we get.",
      "aboutAuthor": "Author, activist, founder of Together Rising, and host of the We Can Do Hard Things podcast Glennon Doyle is the author of the #1 New York Times bestseller Untamed, a Reese’s Book Club selection, which has sold over two million copies. She is also the author of the #1 New York Times bestseller Love Warrior, an Oprah’s Book Club selection, and Carry On, Warrior. An activist and “patron saint of female empowerment” (People), Glennon hosts the We Can Do Hard Things podcast. She is the founder and president of Together Rising, an all-women-led nonprofit organization that has revolutionized grassroots philanthropy—raising over $30 million for women, families, and children in crisis. Glennon lives in Florida with her wife and three children.“She is a terrific storyteller. . . . Whether discussing her children or the world outside, challenging conformity, confronting misogyny, or standing up to religious bigotry, her goal as a memoirist (and as a person) is to defy expectations and to help others break out of their cultural cages so that everyone can find their own version of humanity. A bracing jolt of honesty from someone who knows what she wants to say and isn’t afraid to say it.”—Booklist (starred review)",

But, even 50, three great men have welded our history into something like a coherent whole - Washington, Jackson and Lincoln. The second one of this historic trio represents an era but imperfectly known, and that the man and the times may be better understood is the object of this story, in which fiction plays only a necessary part.

As Bialosky narrates these moments, she illuminates the ways in which particular poems offered insight, compassion, and connection, and shows how poetry can be a blueprint for living. In Poetry Will Save Your Life, Bialosky recalls when she encountered each formative poem, and how its importance and meaning evolved over time, allowing new insights and perceptions to emerge.While Bialosky’s personal stories animate each poem, they touch on many universal experiences, from the awkwardness of girlhood, to crises of faith and identity, from braving a new life in a foreign city to enduring the loss of a loved one, from becoming a parent to growing creatively as a poet and artist. Each moment and poem illustrate “not only how to read poetry, but also how to love poetry” (Christian Science Monitor). ",
      "aboutAuthor": "Jill Bialosky is the author of four acclaimed collections of poetry. Her poems have appeared in The New Yorker, The New York Times, and The Atlantic, among others.

It Carries The Urdu Text With Parallel Roman Script, A New Introduction, Several New Poems -- And Substantive Revisions, Wherever Necessary.Faiz Ahmed Faiz is the most famous contemporary Urdu poet of the twentieth century who appeals both to the common man as well as the elite connoisseurs of poetry. Faiz's ghazals reflect a strong influence of the Persian style and diction, because of which he is often considered the inheritor of the tradition of Ghalib; and at the same time several of them are written in a simple conversational style dealing with the problems of the common man. Faiz was a committed poet who regarded poetry as a vehicle of serious thought rather than just a pleasurable pastime and often used it to champion the cause of socialistic humanism. Born in Sialkot in 1911, Faiz began his career as a lecturer in English but soon turned to journalism where he excelled, rising to the post of editor of The Pakistan Times. In 1951 the Pakistan government sentenced him to four years imprisonment on the charges of complicity in a failed coup attempt known as the Rawalpindi Conspiracy case. While in jail he wrote two of his greatest works, Dasta-e-Saba and Zindan-Nama. During the regime of Zia-ul-Haq he was forced into exile to Beirut. He returned to Pakistan in 1982 and two years later he passed away. This book offers a selection of the best of Faiz's ghazals and nazms along with their English translations as well as transliterations so you can enjoy the beauty and richness of Urdu language as you read the English transliteration while the translation helps you understand the meaning with all its subtle nuances.

The story is set against the conditions that led up to the French Revolution and the Reign of Terror.

In 2003, the novel was ranked 63rd on the BBC's The Big Read poll.The novel has been adapted for film, television, radio, and the stage, and has continued to have an influence on popular culture.",
      "aboutAuthor": "Charles John Huffam Dickens ( 7 February 1812 – 9 June 1870) was an English writer and social critic. He created some of the world's best-known fictional characters and is regarded by many as the greatest novelist of the Victorian era. His works enjoyed unprecedented popularity during his lifetime and, by the 20th century, critics and scholars had recognised him as a literary genius. His novels and short stories are widely read today. Dickens's literary success began with the 1836 serial publication of The Pickwick Papers. Within a few years he had become an international literary celebrity, famous for his humour, satire and keen observation of character and society. His novels, most of them published in monthly or weekly instalments, pioneered the serial publication of narrative fiction, which became the dominant Victorian mode for novel publication. However, Oscar Wilde, Henry James and Virginia Woolf complained of a lack of psychological depth, loose writing and a vein of sentimentalism. The term Dickensian is used to describe something that is reminiscent of Dickens and his writings, such as poor social or working conditions, or comically repulsive characters. "

Along the way, Will tells the story in full of one of the most amazing rides through the worlds of music and film that anyone has ever had.Will Smith's transformation from a fearful child in a tense West Philadelphia home to one of the biggest rap stars of his era and then one of the biggest movie stars in Hollywood history, with a string of box office successes that will likely never be broken, is an epic tale of inner transformation and outer triumph, and Will tells it astonishingly well. But it's only half the story.Will Smith thought, with good reason, that he had won at life: not only was his own success unparalleled, his whole family was at the pinnacle of the entertainment world. Only they didn't see it that way: they felt more like star performers in his circus, a seven-days-a-week job they hadn't signed up for. It turned out Will Smith's education wasn't nearly over.This memoir is the product of a profound journey of self-knowledge, a reckoning with all that your will can get you and all that it can leave behind. Written with the help of Mark Manson, author of the multi-million-copy bestseller The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck, Will is the story of how one exceptional man mastered his own emotions, written in a way that can help everyone else do the same. Few of us will know the pressure of performing on the world's biggest stages for the highest of stakes, but we can all understand that the fuel that works for one stage of our journey might have to be changed if we want to make it all the way home. The combination of genuine wisdom of universal value and a life story that is preposterously entertaining, even astonishing, puts Will the book, like its author, in a category by itself.'Bracingly honest, vivid and compelling ... how an average talent became the biggest movie star in the world' The Times'The Hollywood star's autobiography is full of indiscretions, drug-fuelled escapades and terrible parenting. Who could ask for more?' Telegraph'It's not every day a Hollywood A-lister like Will Smith writes his life story - and there are certainly some eye-popping revelations' Sun'Candid ... digs into the life events which fine-tuned Smith's weapons-grade charisma and steely determination' Observer'I absolutely loved it...no holds barred...I felt as if Will Smith was talking to me. It's a testament to him and to his family' Lorraine Kelly",

      "aboutbook": "‘The Village in the Jungle sits with Burmese Days by George Orwell as the very best of the literature written by servants of the British Empire in the twentieth century [ reflecting] the misgivings Woolf came to feel about the imperial enterprise.’ from the Afterword by Sir Christopher Ondaatje Leonard Woolf, husband of Virginia Woolf, the celebrated author, drew on his own experiences as a colonial civil servant in Ceylon to write this ground-breaking book. It is one of the best-loved and best-known stories in Sri Lanka, even today. The Village in the Jungle describes the lives of a poor family in a tiny isolated village as they struggle to survive. Apart from the problems of poverty, disease, superstition and the pitfalls of the jungle itself, they must contend with an unsympathetic colonial system and the corruption it engenders. The head of the family is a hunter, Silindu, with two daughters. Their lives are shattered when a licentious trader comes to the village and convinces the headman to frame the elder daughter’s husband and send him to prison. Although Silindu tries to intervene, he is put on trial for murder in an English-speaking court where he has no voice. This volume includes a short story, ‘Pearls and Swine’, which vividly draws on Woolf’s own experiences as a young District Commissioner, as well as a new biographical afterword by Sir Christopher Ondaatje, author of Woolf in Ceylon. Packed with first-hand knowledge of the colonial machine, The Village in the Jungle accurately depicts its profound disregard for its subject peoples.",
      "aboutAuthor": "Leonard Woolf was born in London in 1880. In 1904 he joined the Civil Service in Ceylon, working there for several years as a government agent. On his return to England in May 1911 he married Virginia Stephen who was, like her husband, a central figure in the Bloomsbury Group. His first novel, The Village in the Jungle, was published in 1913. He worked as literary editor of the Nation (1923–30), as well as for the Hogarth Press, which he co-founded with Virginia Woolf in 1917. He died in 1969.",

Lily hasn’t always had it easy, but that’s never stopped her from working hard for the life she wants. She’s come a long way from the small town where she grew up—she graduated from college, moved to Boston, and started her own business. And when she feels a spark with a gorgeous neurosurgeon named Ryle Kincaid, everything in Lily’s life seems too good to be true. Ryle is assertive, stubborn, maybe even a little arrogant. He’s also sensitive, brilliant, and has a total soft spot for Lily. And the way he looks in scrubs certainly doesn’t hurt. Lily can’t get him out of her head. But Ryle’s complete aversion to relationships is disturbing. Even as Lily finds herself becoming the exception to his “no dating” rule, she can’t help but wonder what made him that way in the first place. As questions about her new relationship overwhelm her, so do thoughts of Atlas Corrigan—her first love and a link to the past she left behind. He was her kindred spirit, her protector. When Atlas suddenly reappears, everything Lily has built with Ryle is threatened. With this bold and deeply personal novel, It Ends With Us is a heart-wrenching story and an unforgettable tale of love that comes at the ultimate price. ",

New York Times bestseller'Warm, funny, and almost unbearably moving' Daily Mail'Rescued all those men who constantly mean to read novels but never get round to it' Spectator Books of the YearAt first sight, Ove is almost certainly the grumpiest man you will ever meet. He thinks himself surrounded by idiots - neighbours who can't reverse a trailer properly, joggers, shop assistants who talk in code, and the perpetrators of the vicious coup d'etat that ousted him as Chairman of the Residents' Association. He will persist in making his daily inspection rounds of the local streets. But isn't it rare, these days, to find such old-fashioned clarity of belief and deed? Such unswerving conviction about what the world should be, and a lifelong dedication to making it just so?In the end, you will see, there is something about Ove that is quite irresistible. .",

They might be with you forever or have left you at some point, but their names are carved in gold in your heart. Every time you hear their name or think about them, a smile creeps onto your lips or a tear escapes your lids. Well, that’s the idea of this story. The story is about Aarav Khanna, a Fashion Designer from NIFT who works at a call centre because of certain circumstances. He has a girlfriend, a good friend at work, a contented life, a handsome face and a job, enough for a guy to be happy with. And then he meets Ada Maciel, a Mechanical engineering student, a preplanned online friendship from the Metro girl’s (Ada) side brings them close and soon enough they become friends. The story goes on with their nurturing friendship and then caring for each other. Aarav’s confusion about his feelings, the ups and downs in his office friend’s life, Ada’s presence, Aarav’s own life and last but not the least, his girlfriend are the things that make up the entire book. The book ends after a time leap of 25 years, it's almost like the narrator describing Aarav’s story from the past. The story ends on a beautiful note and it probably must be one of the most beautiful endings. It also teaches us an important lesson, “When something you dreadfully need is within your reach, then grab it as soon as you can because You never know when you will be late to do so.",

Waking up from a long coma, Daman learns that he was in a massive car crash with a girl who vanished soon after the accident, leaving him for dead.

However, he gives in to editorial pressure and agrees to corrupt the original edgy character of Shreyasi. Big mistake. From then on Daman is stalked and threatened by a terrifying beauty who claims to be Shreyasi and who will stop at nothing to make him pay for being a sell-out.

Despite many efforts to triumph over her, he fails but repudiates to give up. She unknowingly unveils many secrets that question his faith and further strengthen the pledge to have her. However, close to reaching the destination, a misunderstanding clouds his mind.  What follows next is the interesting voyage of Raghav and Areeti, facing their own apprehensions and challenges created by the past and the present. The hurdles don’t seem to end and, in every turn, a new secret, hidden characters, unprecedented twists and dark chapters from the history continue to batter their resilience and resolution. It is a story of friendship, love, sacrifice, separation, pain, secrets, mystery, betrayal and vengeance. It emphasizes how in the face of adversities love can fail, but yet stand up to fight, and how sometimes to survive amongst enemies we need to become the weapon itself.",

The only problem is that she can’t admit her true feelings, because he clearly sees her as a best friend with no romantic potential, and the last thing Bree wants is to ruin their relationship. But those abs .Nope! Nothing but good old-fashioned, no-touching-the-sexiest-man-alive, platonic friendship for Bree. In any case, she has other things to worry about. After a car accident ended her chance at becoming a professional ballerina, Bree changed paths and now owns her own dance studio, with big dreams to expand it. But one more rent increase could mean the end of the studio entirely.Then, as usual, Nathan comes to the rescue and buys the entire building. A stubborn Bree is not happy about it and decides to rebel with a couple—okay, maybe more than a couple—of tequila shots. Then her plan backfires as she spills her deepest, darkest secret to a TMZ reporter. One viral video later, the world thinks Nathan and Bree are the perfect couple. Before they can really talk about her confession, Nathan’s publicist proposes a big opportunity that could mean financial security for Bree. The catch? They have to pretend to be in love. For three whole weeks.      ",

Yet, remarkably, the setting for this classic spiritual text is an ancient Indian battlefield. At the last moment, the great warrior, Arjuna, begins to wonder about the real meaning of his life. Lord Krishna brings His disciple from perplexity to spiritual enlightenment by sharing with him what has come to be known as the Gita. In this interpretation of the Gita, the author explains that the essence of the Gita is the equanimity of mind, which is attained by transcending it because mind consciousness is myopic and only spiritual consciousness abounds in universal love and absolute knowledge. Bhakti yoga, Gyan yoga, and Karma yoga are not the only paths that can lead a seeker to the promised land (moksha), but performance of one’s duty, rendered selflessly with dedication and devotion, too can lead a man to God as assuredly as the other spiritual paths. In fact it is a misconception that Lord Krishna prompted Arjuna to perpetrate war. Lord Krishna exhorted Arjuna only to perform his duty as a warrior in the battlefield, which would lead him to liberation. This best-selling and expanded edition of the most famous and popular of Indian scriptures, contextualizes the book culturally and historically and explains the key concepts of Hindu religious thought and the technical vocabulary of yoga. Chapter introductions, notes, and a glossary help readers understand the book’s message better. Most importantly, the translation uses simple, clear language to impart the poetry, universality, and timelessness of the Gita’s teachings.",
